        <p>I feel deeply enthousiast by creating aesthetic web designs and nice experiences for users.‚Ä®‚Ä® <br> <br> I have started to explore and learn by myself core concepts of UX/UI Design. Programming also makes me being more realistic and simple when working on design projects and thinking about user features. <br> <br> I am currently working on designing an app that I had in mind a long time ago: Skatrr</p>

        <p>My name is Vincent, a french young man freshly graduated. My ambitions are to start my own business companies. I appreciate every form of creation, from company to art. What I like in the creation process is the excitment, the energy to give a form and direction to an idea and grow with it. <br><br> Now, I feel like I need more experience first. I am seeking jobs in project development or product management in a dynamic environment, but also in web development and web design. <br><br>If some of you are familiar with Japanese culture and the 5 Ikiga√Ø pillars (which I recommend you to apply on your daily life), one of them is to ‚Äústart small‚Äù. I know everyone need to start somewhere, somehow. I would be pleased to be part of a project or responsible for it. <br><br> If you are looking for a nice team-player and eager to learn, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vincent-clair-2398a5136/" target="_blank">get in touch!</a></p>
