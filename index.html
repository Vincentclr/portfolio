      <p>I started learning how to code in summer 2020. I learned in Le Wagon bootcamp basis of web programmation, from back-end  (Ruby)to front-end (HTML/CSS/JS). I discovered how to work in a developer team with versioning tools. I also learned effective communication and can apply it into future projects. For the moment I am focused on front-end development. I work on side projects to improve my JavaScript and ReactJS skills.</p>

      <p>I feel deeply enthousiast by creating aesthetic web designs  and nice experiences for users.  I have started to explore and learn by myself core concepts of UX/UI Design.  Programming also makes me being more realistic and simple when working on design projects. I am fascinated by 3d animations and content. I played a bit with some CSS/SASS. Check it out!</p>

      <p>I’m Vincent, a french young man freshly graduated. My ambitions are to start my own business companies. I appreciate every form of creation, from company to art. What I like in the creation process is the excitment, the energy to give a form and direction to an idea and grow with it. Now, I feel like I need more experience first. I am seeking jobs in project development or product management in a dynamic environment, but also in web development and web design. If some of you are familiar with Japanese culture and the 5 Ikigaï pillars (which I recommend you to apply on your daily life), one of them is to “start small”. I know everyone need to start somewhere, somehow. I would be pleased to be part of a project or responsible for it. If you are looking for a nice team-player and eager to learn, <a href="">get in touch!</a></p>
