          <br>
          <h3>Pitch</h3>
          <br>
          <p>Skatrr is a mobile app to locate street spots and upload skate videos about best lines and tricks. Skaters choose Skatrr to get out of traditional crowded skate parks or damaged structures, and find some creative and secret spots.</p>
          <br>
          <span id="dots-two"></span>
          <div id="more-two">
            <h3>Context</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Skateboarding is everywhere. You see it on TV, in movies, on cereal boxes, the Internet, and around town. Skateboarding is popular with spectators and participants. Skaters and their fans come from all walks of life. They’re men and women, boys and girls. You might be a skateboarder, or you know a skateboarder. If you’re a teenager, the odds are good that you’ve stood on a skateboard within the last year, and you know lots of people that skate. Many adults spent their youth skateboarding. People all over the world skate and there are skateparks to prove it. Even in the smallest towns and villages you can find a few local youth working on their skateboarding skills. It is surprising to learn that many cities and towns don’t have a single skatepark or in poor condition. It’s easy to find a football field almost anywhere you go. Yet when it comes to skateboarding, skaters have little choice but to ride on the sidewalks, on the streets, school campuses, parking lots, and other places around town… or simply don’t skate at all. </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Target</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Of all skaters, 77.1% are male, whereas 83.4% of core skaters are male. Conversely, 23.9% of all skaters are female, while 16.6% of all core skaters are female.</p>
            <p>Skateboarding, for many, becomes the recreational activity of choice well into adulthood. Market research studies reveal that skateboarders are, on average, 14 year old males. 40% of skateboarders are between 6 to 12 years old and 30% are 13 to 17 years old (source: BoardTrac). It also appear that it is the new generation that is the most concerned by using social networks and are confortable with using new digital technologies.</p>
            <p>The hallmark of skateboarding culture is that it is welcoming to anyone that approaches it with the intention of improving his or her personal skill. Class, race, gender, weight, and other hobbies are irrelevant provided that the participant’s enthusiasm for the actual act of skateboarding is genuine. In this way, skateboarding is egalitarian and inclusive. Because skateboarding is not a team sport, the success and/or enjoyment of skaters is not dependent on other skaters’ performance. In other words, an experienced skateboarder can recreate with someone learning fundamental skills as equals. There is nothing to gain or lose from seeing other people land a trick for the first time except for the joy of seeing them do it.</p>
